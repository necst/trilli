## SimpleITK

This subfolder presents a code-base for SimpleITK, a python wrapper for ITK. 
We remind that a copy of such results is already provided in the csv and can be used to replicate images. Nevertheless, follow the instructions to replicate them. Notice that it may take around 1hr depending on the used system.  

*Note: To execute such test about complete image registration, please contact the authors. We will privately send you the dataset*

### Step 1: Setup Dependencies

we suggest to use python3.8 to guarantee fair results. A detailed guide for the setup can be found here: [SimpleITK](https://simpleitk.readthedocs.io/en/master/gettingStarted.html)

### Step 2: Run the tests

    ```bash
    ./execute_test.sh 
    ```
