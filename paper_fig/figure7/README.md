# ðŸ“Š Figure 7 - Latency Improvement Analysis

This folder contains the necessary files for plotting **Figure 7**. 

> **Important:** Ensure that LaTeX fonts are enabled in Python to guarantee correct image rendering.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Figure 7 presents a execution time comparison against literature solutions accelerated on FPGAs, CPUs or GPUs. We evaluate standalone
image transformation and interpolation (a), its integration with MI (b), and the complete 3D image registration application (c)

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Script
To execute the code, simply run:

```
python3 figure7.py
```
